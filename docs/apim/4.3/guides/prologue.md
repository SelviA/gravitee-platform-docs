# Prologue

The _guides_ section is here to dive into everything you need to know in order to use the Gravitee API Management (APIM) platform and its extensive feature set. As of now, the guides focus on the following categories of usage:

* Creating APIs
* Designing policies
* Configuring plans, subscriptions, and applications
* Ensuring API performance and measuring API consumption
* How to push APIs to and use the Gravitee Developer Portal for API Discovery
* How to administer your Gravitee platform and users
* How to contribute to the Gravitee platform as a Developer

Each guide will begin by detailing relevant, high-level concepts to the reader. From there, the reader can select any subpage in the sidebar to learn how to actually use the specific feature they're most interested in.
