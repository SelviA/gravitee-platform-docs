## Introduction

Gravitee offers various configuration for v4 APIs via the API Management Console. This section discusses:

* [**General settings**](general-info-settings.md)**:** Define the general settings for your API, such as name, description, and deployment status
* [**General entrypoint configuration**](entrypoints/)**:** Define the protocol and configuration settings by which the API consumer accesses the Gateway API
* [**Backend service configuration**](endpoints/)**:** Configure the backend target or resource that your Gateway API will call / subscribe to
* [**Quality of Service**](quality-of-service.md)**:** Provides QoS definitions and a support matrix for entrypoint/endpoint combinations
* [**User permissions**](user-permissions.md)**:** Add members or groups to your API, or transfer API ownership
* [**Audit logs**](audit-logs.md)**:** View and filter the audit logs and events
* [**Version history**](version-history.md)**:** View an API's deployment history and the JSON definition of each API version
* [**Documentation**](documentation.md)**:** Add documentation pages and folders to your API, which can be viewed in the Developer Portal
