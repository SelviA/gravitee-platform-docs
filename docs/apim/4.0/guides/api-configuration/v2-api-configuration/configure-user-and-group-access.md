{% @arcade/embed flowId="T68J1lMLPo7xwHhsqucb" url="https://app.arcade.software/share/T68J1lMLPo7xwHhsqucb" %}

## Introduction

You can manage user and group access to individual APIs. This article walks through that process. If you want to learn more about user and group creation and administration, please refer to the [User Management and Permissions ](../../administration/user-management-and-permissions.md)documentation.

## Configure API user and group access

To configure user and group access for your APIs, navigate to the APIs list, and select your API. Then, select **User and group access**.

### Add members to your API

Here, you can add members to your API by using the **+ Add members icon**, as well as alter member roles. These roles come with specific permissions. For more information on roles, please refer to the [roles documentation.](../../administration/user-management-and-permissions.md#roles)

### Add groups to your API

To give groups access to your API, select the **Groups** tab, and select the desired group from the Groups dropdown. This will give all members of that group access to your API.

### Transfer API ownership

If you are the owner of the API, you can transfer ownership of the API to another member, user, or group. To this, select the **Transfer ownership** tab, and select either **API member**, **Other user**, or **Group.** Then, select the stakeholder to which you want to transfer API ownership.
