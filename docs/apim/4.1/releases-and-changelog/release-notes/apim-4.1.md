## Introduction

Gravitee 4.1 was released on September 28th, 2023, and introduced DB-less mode, enhancements to v4 API configuration, the ability to import and duplicate v4 APIs, and improved logging capabilities. For a pared-down version of what was released, please see the [changelog for Gravitee APIM 4.x](../changelogs/apim-4.1.x-changelog.md).

## DB-less mode

DB-less mode allows a Gateway to be deployed with no dependencies, assuming only that there is an operator running in the same cluster or namespace. Although the setup does not include Elasticsearch or MongoDB, analytics can still be configured using a custom reporter such as Datadog, TCP with Logstash, etc. For more information on configuring a DB-less deployment, see [this section](../../getting-started/install-guides/install-on-kubernetes/configure-helm-chart.md#db-less-mode-minimum-configuration-example).

## v4 API configuration

### Webhook entrypoint

You can enable Dead Letter Queue to define an external storage where each unsuccessfully pushed message will be stored and configure a replay strategy. A pre-existing and supported endpoint or endpoint group can be selected. This is an advanced configuration that requires having the endpoint already configured. Refer to the [configuration details](../../guides/api-configuration/v4-api-configuration/entrypoint-configuration.md#webhook) for more information.

### Endpoint management and defaults

Endpoints and endpoint groups that have already been configured can be modified or deleted. Single endpoints and endpoint groups can also be added following initial endpoint configuration. By default, the API will use the first endpoint group listed, but the user is able to change the order of the list.

The configuration of an endpoint during the creation workflow determines the endpoint groupâ€™s default configuration. The endpoint then inherits this configuration from the group by default. Unless inheritance is disabled, changes to the endpoint group configuration will proliferate to all endpoints in the group.

By default, an endpoint added to an endpoint group will inherit the group's configuration. This allows an API publisher to quickly add new endpoints with the same settings and behavior as other endpoints in the group. Changes can be made to the new endpoint's configuration if inheritance is disabled, and will persist if inheritance remains disabled.

### User and group access&#x20;

{% @arcade/embed flowId="cFPsuQlW9Jd8KOvrvnLM" url="https://app.arcade.software/share/cFPsuQlW9Jd8KOvrvnLM" %}

You can manage user and group access to individual APIs via the Management Console. You can add members to your API and alter member roles, which come with specific permissions. You can also add groups to your API to give all members of those groups access. In addition, the owner of an API can transfer ownership to another member, user, or group by selecting a stakeholder and assigning that stakeholder a role. For more information, refer to [this guide](../../guides/api-configuration/v2-api-configuration/configure-user-and-group-access.md).

### Quality of Service

4.1 introduces enhanced QoS support for various entrypoint, protocol, and endpoint selections. The QoS compatibility matrix can be found [here](../../guides/api-configuration/v4-api-configuration/quality-of-service.md).

## Importing and duplicating v4 APIs

You can now create a v4 API by uploading a JSON file containing an existing Gravitee v4 API definition. For the details of this feature, refer to the [documentation](../../guides/create-apis/import-apis/).

A v4 API can now also be duplicated. Refer to [this page](../../guides/api-configuration/v4-api-configuration/api-general-settings.md) for more details.

## Logging

The Management Console now allows you to view comprehensive connection logs to analyze the usage of your v4 message APIs. The record will be paginated with no limit to the number of pages, and if logging is disabled, existing logs will still be displayed.&#x20;

Runtime log settings can be modified to customize and extend the data capture. You can also drill into a log entry to view detailed message content. For more information on logging, refer to [this section](broken-reference).
