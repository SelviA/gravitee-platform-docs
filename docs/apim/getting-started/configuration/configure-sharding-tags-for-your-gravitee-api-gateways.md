# Sharding Tags



{% hint style="warning" %}
**Enterprise only**

As of Gravitee 4.0, the sharding Tags feature is an Enterprise Edition capability. To learn more about Gravitee Enterprise, and what's included in various enterprise packages, please:

* [Refer to the EE vs OSS documentation](../../overview/introduction-to-gravitee-api-management-apim/ee-vs-oss.md)
* [Book a demo](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/8qli0UVuPJ39JJdq9ebZ/s/rYZ7tzkLjFVST6ex6Jid/)
* [Check out the pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**v4 API limitations**

As of Gravitee 4.0, you cannot implement sharding tags for v4 APIs using the APIM Console. You can only do it via the [Management API](../../reference/management-api-reference/).&#x20;

## Introduction

Sharding tags allow you to “tag” a Gateway with a specific keyword. Once a Gateway is tagged, you will be able to deploy an API and select which (sharding) tag a Gateway should have in order for the API to be deployed on a Gateway. To learn more about how to deploy APIs to specific Gateways based on sharding tags, refer to [this documentation](../../guides/api-configuration/v2-api-configuration/configure-cors.md#configure-deployments).

### Configure sharding tags for your Gravitee API Gateways

The following section focuses on how to configure sharding tags. We will explain the steps assuming that our architecture includes both DMZ gateways and internal, corporate gateways. We want to tag these gateways as external only and internal only, respectively. Please see the corresponding diagram below:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Example architecture (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Before you can start defining sharding tags in the Gravitee API Management Console, you will need to do some work in your API Gateway `gravitee.yaml` file. To assign a Gravitee API Gateway to a specific sharding tag for the above scenario and architecture, make the following changes in the `gravitee.yaml` file:

```
DMZ Gateways: 
tags: ‘external’
```

```
Internal Network Gateways:
tags: ‘internal’
```

You can also add more nuance to this sharding tag strategy. Gateways can be tagged with one or more sharding tags. You can also specify exclusion rules by including the`!` symbol before the tag name. For example, imagine you have Gateways tagged as “external” and also as “partner”. If you wanted to configure a Gateway so that it can host external APIs that are not dedicated to partners (maybe you have different Gateways assigned to partners), you would configure the sharding tag like this:

```
tags: ‘product,store,!partner’
```

Once the gateways have been tagged, you will need to define the same sharding tags within API Manager. To do this, follow these steps:

1\. Log in to your API Management Console.

2\. In the left-hand nav, select **Organization**.

3\. In the Organization page, select **Sharding tags**.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/ef5532a2-ba56-49ae-b438-041ed3ff5c9d/1.5/0.34722222222222/42.47618558114?0)

4\. Select **+ Add a tag.**

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/50391eb9-7eda-480f-97ce-4f86d6bfb9d7/1.5/84.548611111111/24.835526315789?0)

5\. Now, it's time to create the same tags that created using the `gravitee.yaml` file. Make sure that the tag you create has the same exact name as the tag in the `gravitee.yaml file`. First, I'll create the "internal" tag using the **Name** field.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/71721c67-2277-400a-b577-790311e3d38d/2.5/50/43.23516310307?0)

6\. You can choose to restrict groups. This restricts usage of this tag to certain groups, as defined in Gravitee user adminstration. We'll skip this, as its totally optional.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/56135924-46cc-45a5-baf2-69e0e937ef5a/2.5/50/54.913651315789?0)

7\. When you're done, select **Ok**.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/a27f351a-c1c3-44a5-ac8c-f6d15b4a7eba/2.5/60.272442853009/75.206448739035?0)

8\. Now, let's add the "external" tag. Follow the same steps as you did for the "internal" tag.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/ca600fb5-e338-48a4-ab61-9a12292442d9/2.5/84.548611111111/24.835526315789?0)

9\. Gravitee also provides a way to automatically apply a sharding tag to APIs based on the entrypoint. This will instruct Gravitee API Manager to apply the “external” tag to all APIs with this entry point, resulting in the related APIs to be deployed on your chosen Gateway. To do so, follow these steps:

10\. Select **+ Add a mapping**.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/8c0374a0-999f-43f2-bccb-61c507a001c8/1.5/84.548611111111/49.819401444788?0)

11\. In the **Entrypoint url** field, enter in your Entrypoint url.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/397a968c-5ae8-4d85-9b4c-5f534a0d9132/2/50/49.980650154799?0)

12\. In the **Sharding tags** drop down menu, select the proper tag that you want mapped to your entrypoints. I'll choose my internal tag.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/505ea3bc-5fb0-4bbe-8d8b-229e67f1f7c7/1/50/50?0)

14\. When done, select **Ok**.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/23db58e8-6576-49aa-a51f-9fdcd37073cb/1.5/60.272442853009/69.892447110423?0)

You'll now see your entrypoint mapping in the Entrypoint mappings section.
