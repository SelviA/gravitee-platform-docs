# Policy Studio

## Overview

The Gravitee Policy Studio allows you to design "flows," or policy enforcement sequences that protect, transform, or otherwise alter how APIs are consumed. Gravitee offers a number of preconfigured policies, some of which are available in the Community Edition while others are only available in Gravitee's Enterprise Edition. For more information on specific policies, please refer to the [Policy Reference](../../reference/policy-reference/) documentation.

### v2 Policy Studio and v4 Policy Studio

As of Gravitee APIM 4.0, there are two Policy Studio options:

* **v4 Policy Studio**: this Policy Studio enables you to design Policy flows for v4 APIs
* **v2 Policy Studio**: this Policy Studio enables you to design Policy flows for v2 APIs

Please refer to the proper Policy Studio documentation, based on your API type.
