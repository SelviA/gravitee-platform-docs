# Custom Policies

## Overview

Policies are rules or logic that can be executed by the API Gateway during an API transaction. A policy acts as a proxy controller by guaranteeing that a given business rule is fulfilled during the processing of an API transaction.

Let's look at an example of how to develop a policy.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before you start, don't forget to activate [OSS repositories](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) in your [Maven settings](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html).
{% endhint %}

## Policy skeleton generation

Imagine you want to create a policy that validates whether or not requests contains the `X-Foo` header. Let's name it the _FooHeaderCheck_ policy. The skeleton for this policy can be generated with the following code:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate\
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.gravitee.maven.archetypes\
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=gravitee-policy-maven-archetype\
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.10.1\
    -DartifactId=foo-header-check-policy\
    -DgroupId=my.gravitee.extension.policy\
    -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\
    -DpolicyName=FooHeaderCheck
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Naming a policy**

When generating a policy, choose a short but clear name for it, _without specifying the policy suffix_. The `gravitee-policy-maven-archetype` will add it automatically. For example, _do not_ specify the `policyName` of your policy like this:

```
-DpolicyName=AmazingStuffPolicy
```

Instead, do it like this:

```
-DpolicyName=AmazingStuff
```
{% endhint %}

The above command will create the `foo-header-check-policy` directory containing the following structure:

```
.
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── assembly
    │   └── policy-assembly.xml
    ├── main
    │   ├── java
    │   │   └── my
    │   │       └── gravitee
    │   │           └── extension
    │   │               └── policy
    │   │                   ├── FooHeaderCheckPolicyConfiguration.java

                            └── FooHeaderCheckPolicyTest.java
```

The different generated files are as follows:

| File                                     | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pom.xml`                                | The main Maven POM file                                           |
| `README.md`                              | The main entry point for the policy documentation                 |
| `policy-assembly.xml`                    | The common Maven assembly descriptor for any policies             |
| `FooHeaderCheckPolicyConfiguration.java` | The policy configuration class                                    |
| `plugin.properties`                      | The policy descriptor file                                        |
| `FooHeaderCheckPolicyTest.java`          | The policy unit test Java class                                   |
| `FooHeaderCheckPolicy.java`              | The policy class, from which the business behavior is implemented |

### `pom.xml`

Each policy (and more generally all Gravitee projects) are [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) managed. A policy project is described by using the Maven [Project Object Model](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html) file.

### `README.md`

Each policy should have a dedicated `README.md` file to document it. The `README.md` file should contain everything related to the use of your policy: _What is its functionality? How can you use it? How can you configure it?_

### `policy-assembly.xml`

A policy is just a kind of Gravitee plugin.

It can be plugged into the APIM Gateway by using the distribution file built from the `policy-assembly.xml` file.

Based on our _FooHeaderCheck_ policy, the distribution file structure is as follows:

```
.
├── foo-header-check-policy-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
├── lib
└── schemas
    └── urn:jsonschema:my:gravitee:extension:policy:FooHeaderCheckPolicyConfiguration.json
```

The different generated files are as follows:

| File                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `foo-header-check-policy-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` | The main _policy_ jar file                                                                                                                                                 |
| `lib/`                                       | Where the external dependencies are stored (from the [Maven POM file dependencies](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html) |
| `schemas/`                                   | Where the JSON configuration schemas are stored                                                                                                                            |

### `FooHeaderCheckPolicyConfiguration.java`

The policy configuration class.

Policy configuration is described in one or several [Java Bean](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/) class(es) where each attribute is a configuration parameter.

During packaging, policy configuration is compiled into JSON Configuration schemas. These schemas are used to parse [API definitions](https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-gateway).

Policy configuration is injected into the policy class instance at runtime and can then be used during implementation.

#### JSON configuration schemas

During the packaging phase, each policy configuration class is processed to generate one or several [JSON schema(s)](http://json-schema.org) that will be read by the Gateway when the policy is plugged in.

JSON schema generation is performed by Gravitee's [json-schema-generator-maven-plugin](https://github.com/gravitee-io/json-schema-generator-maven-plugin) Maven plugin.

### `plugin.properties`

As mentioned previously, a policy is a kind of Gravitee plugin. Each plugin is described by the _plugin.properties_ descriptor which declares the following parameters:

| Parameter     | Description                        | Default value                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | The policy identifier              | policy artifact id                                                           |
| `name`        | The policy name                    | N/A (mandatory parameter)                                                    |
| `version`     | The policy version                 | N/A (mandatory parameter)                                                    |
| `description` | The policy description             | "Description of the _Policy name_ Gravitee Policy"                           |
| `class`       | The main policy class              | Path to the generated class file                                             |
| `type`        | The type of Gravitee plugin        | `policy`                                                                     |
| `category`    | The policy category                |                                                                              |
| `icon`        | The policy icon                    |                                                                              |
| `proxy`       | The policy's proxy manifest data   | N/A (options include REQUEST, RESPONSE)                                      |
| `message`     | The policy's message manifest data | N/A (options include REQUEST, RESPONSE, MESSAGE\_REQUEST, MESSAGE\_RESPONSE) |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Policy ID**

A policy is enabled when declared in the API definition. The policy identifier is used, as its name suggests, to identify the policy. You must ensure you choose the correct policy identifier from the outset. It may be hard to rename it later if there are many API definitions linked to it.
{% endhint %}

### `FooHeaderCheckPolicyTest.java`

The [JUnit](http://junit.org/) unit test class for this policy.

### `FooHeaderCheckPolicy.java`

The main policy class. Contains business code that implements the policy.

## Policy Application

A policy can be applied on several parts of the proxy chain:

* The Request phase
* The Response phase
* Both of them

### Apply policy during the Request phase

A policy can be applied to the proxy Request phase by just implementing a method dealing with the `io.gravitee.gateway.api.policy.annotations.OnRequest` annotation. For instance:

```java
@OnRequest
public void onRequest(Request request, Response response, PolicyChain policyChain) {
    // Add a dummy header
    request.headers().set("X-DummyHeader", configuration.getDummyHeaderValue());

    // Finally continue chaining
    policyChain.doNext(request, response);
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The `PolicyChain` must always be called to end `onRequest` processing. Ensure you make a call to the `PolicyChain#doNext()` or `PolicyChain#failWith()` to correctly end the `onRequest` processing.
{% endhint %}

### Apply policy during the Response phase

A policy can be applied to the proxy Response phase by just implementing a method that works with the `io.gravitee.gateway.api.policy.annotations.OnResponse` annotation. For instance:

```java
@OnResponse
public void onResponse(Request request, Response response, PolicyChain policyChain) {
    if (isASuccessfulResponse(response)) {
        policyChain.doNext(request, response);
    } else {
        policyChain.failWith(new PolicyResult() {
            @Override
            public boolean isFailure() {
                return true;
            }

            @Override
            public int httpStatusCode() {
                return HttpStatusCode.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR_500;
            }

            @Override
            public String message() {
                return "Not a successful response :-(";
            }
        });
    }
}

private static boolean isASuccessfulResponse(Response response) {
    switch (response.status() / 100) {
        case 1:
        case 2:
        case 3:
            return true;
        default:
            return false;
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The `PolicyChain` must always be called to end `onResponse` processing. Ensure you make a call to the `PolicyChain#doNext()` or `PolicyChain#failWith()` to correctly end the `onResponse` processing.
{% endhint %}

### Apply policy during both the Request and Response phases

A policy is not restricted to only one Gateway proxy phase. It can be applied during both the Request and Response phases by simply using both annotations in the same class.

### Provided parameters

The annotated methods can declare several parameters (but not necessarily all of them) which will be automatically provided by the Gateway at runtime.

Available parameters are:

| Parameter class                                | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `io.gravitee.gateway.api.Request`              | No        | Wrapper to the Request object containing all information about the processed request (URI, parameters, headers, input stream, …) |
| `io.gravitee.gateway.api.Response`             | No        | Wrapper to the Response object containing all information about the processed response (status, headers, output stream, …)       |
| `io.gravitee.gateway.api.policy.PolicyChain`   | Yes       | The current policy chain that gives control to the policy to continue (`doNext`) or reject (`failWith`) the current chain.       |
| `io.gravitee.gateway.api.policy.PolicyContext` | No        | The policy context that can be used to get contextualized objects (API store, …).                                                |
