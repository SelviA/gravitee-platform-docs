# User and Group Access

{% @arcade/embed flowId="cFPsuQlW9Jd8KOvrvnLM" url="https://app.arcade.software/share/cFPsuQlW9Jd8KOvrvnLM" %}

## Introduction

You can manage user and group access to individual APIs. This article walks through that process. If you want to learn more about user and group creation and administration, please refer to the [User Management and Permissions ](../../administration/user-management-and-permissions.md)documentation.

## Configure API user and group access

To configure user and group access for an API, go to **APIs** in the left nav and select your API. Then go to **User and group access** in the inner left nav.

### Add members to your API

You can add members to your API by using the **+ Add members icon**, as well as alter member roles. These roles come with specific permissions. For more information on roles, please refer to the [roles documentation.](../../administration/user-management-and-permissions.md#roles)

### Add groups to your API

To give groups access to your API, select the **Groups** tab, and select the desired group from the **Groups** dropdown. This will give all members of that group access to your API.

### Transfer API ownership

If you are the owner of the API, you can transfer ownership of the API to another member, user, or group. To do this, select the **Transfer ownership** tab, then select either **API member**, **Other user**, or **Group.** Next, select the stakeholder to which you want to transfer API ownership and assign that stakeholder a role.
