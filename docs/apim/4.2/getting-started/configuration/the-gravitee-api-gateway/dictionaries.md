# Dictionaries

## Introduction

While API Publishers can create properties for their own APIs, dictionaries provide a way to manage properties independent of individual APIs, making it possible to apply them across APIs and maintain them globally by a different user profile, such as an administrator.

Dictionary properties are based on key-value pairs. You can create two types of dictionaries:

* Manual dictionaries, with static properties defined manually at dictionary creation time
* Dynamic dictionaries, with properties updated continually, based on a schedule and source URL defined at dictionary creation time

Dictionaries need to be deployed to the API Gateway before you can use them. You can see the date and time the dictionary was last deployed in the dictionary list:

### How are dictionaries used?

You can use dictionaries anywhere in APIM where [Gravitee Expression Language](../../../guides/gravitee-expression-language.md) is supported, such as when defining policies for API flows. You can access dictionary properties with the Expression Language statement `#dictionaries`.

## Create a new dictionary

To create a bew dictionary, select **Settings** in the left-hand nav. Then, select **Dictionaries.**

Then, select the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-06-28 at 10.18.10 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">icon. You'll be brought to the **Create a new dictionary** page. Here, you'll need to define the **Name, Description,** and **Type.** You'll have two options for **Dictionary type:**

* **Manual**: these dictionaries are made up of static properties defined manually at dictionary creation time
* **Dynamic**: these dictionaries are made up of properties that are updated continually, based on a schedule and source URL defined at dictionary creation time

### Create a manual dictionary

To create a manual dictionary, choose **Manual** as the **Type**, and then select **Create.** You'll then be brought to a page where you can define the static properties for your dictionary. To create properties, select the <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-06-28 at 10.22.56 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">icon.

Then, just give your properties a name and a value.

When you're done, select Add, and then **Save Properties** when you are done defining your key-value pairs. To then start and deploy your dictionary, select **Deploy.**

### Create a dynamic dictionary

To create a manual dictionary, choose **Dynamic** as the **Type**. **Trigger** and **Provider** sections will then appear.

#### Define your Trigger settings

The Trigger defines the schedule for which dynamic properties will be created. Define the **Interval** and the **Time Unit** (seconds, minutes, hours).

#### Define your Provider settings

In the **Provider** section, specify the details of the source of the properties:

* A **Type** of **Custom (HTTP)**.
* **HTTP Service URL**: the URL and method of the API providing the properties
* Enable or disable **Use system proxy**
* The **HTTP Methods**
* The request body
* One or more HTTP headers
* The transformation to apply to the response, in JOLT format

When you're done, select Create and then Start. Gravitee APIM will then start to retrieve the properties along the interval defined and lists them in the **Properties** section

From here, you can select any properties you want to delete and/or select **Deploy** to deploy your Dictionary to your Gravitee API Gateway.

**Example**

The following example creates a list of properties based on extracting the names and versions from the JSON at the defined URL and assigning them to the property keys and values:

When you select **Start**, the properties are added to the list according to the defined schedule:
