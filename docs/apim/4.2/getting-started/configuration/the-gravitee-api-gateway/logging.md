# Logging

## Introduction

Gravitee allows you to capture logs at both the API and Gateway levels. This article describes how to configure logging at the Gateway level.

If you want to configure logs at the API level, please refer to the [Configure and Use API Logging documentation](../../../guides/api-measurement-tracking-and-analytics/configure-and-use-api-logging.md).
{% endhint %}

## Configure logging at the Gateway level

To configure logging permissions and settings at the Gateway level:

1. Select **Settings** from the left sidebar of the Management Console
2. Select **API Logging** from the inner left sidebar

You can choose to enable:

* Auditing API Logging consultation
* End user information displayed as part of API logging (this is useful if you are using an OAuth2 or JWT plan)
* Generation of API logging as audit events (API\_LOGGING\_ENABLED, API\_LOGGING\_DISABLED, API\_LOGGING\_UPDATED)

You can also define the maximum duration (in ms) of logging mode activation by entering a numeric value in the **Maximum duration** text field.
