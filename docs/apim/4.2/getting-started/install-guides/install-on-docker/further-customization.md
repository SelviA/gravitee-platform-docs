# Further Customization

This page explains how to further customize your Docker installation.

## Installing additional plugins

APIM Docker images contain the default plugins. To add an additional plugin, copy the plugin archive (a `.zip` file) into the `plugins-ext` folder. If you used the file structure described in [the custom install section](custom-install-with-docker-compose.md), the `plugin-ext` folder is `/gravitee/apim-gateway/plugins` for the API Gateway and `/gravitee/apim-management-api/plugins` for the Management API.

You can download additional plugins from [the plugins download page](https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-apim/plugins/).

For more information, about plugin deployment, see [Deployment](broken-reference).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some plugins need to be installed on both the API Gateway and the Management API. Please verify the specific pluginâ€™s documentation for the details.

## Use Redis as the datastore for rate-limiting counters

### Using with `docker compose`

To use Redis with `docker compose`, edit the `$services.gateway.environment` section of the Docker compose file to include the following lines, and remove the line containing `gravitee_ratelimit_mongodb_uri`.

{% code title="docker-compose.yaml" %}
```yaml
      - gravitee_ratelimit_type=redis
      - gravitee_ratelimit_redis_host=gravitee-redis
      - gravitee_ratelimit_redis_port=6379
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Redis host and port may be different.
{% endhint %}

### Using with Docker images

To use Redis with Docker images, add the following environment variables to the command used to start the API Gateway.

```sh
  --env gravitee_ratelimit_type=redis \
  --env gravitee_ratelimit_redis_host=gravitee-redis \
  --env gravitee_ratelimit_redis_port=6379 \
```

You also need to remove the `gravitee_ratelimit_mongodb_uri` `env` from the command.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Redis host and port may be different.
{% endhint %}

## Use JDBC connection as the datastore for management

To use JDBC as the datastore for management, you have to have the correct JDBC driver installed on the API Gateway and the Management API, and you have to start the containers using some additional environment variables.

### Download the driver

1. Download the correct driver for your database from [Supported databases.](../../../plugins-and-integrations/plugins/configure-repositories/#supported-databases)
2. Place it in the `plugins-ext` folder. If you used the file structure described in the [custom install section](custom-install-with-docker-compose.md), the `plugin-ext` folder is `/gravitee/apim-gateway/plugins` for the API Gateway and `/gravitee/apim-management-api/plugins` for the Management API.

For more information on the JDBC plugin and drivers, see [JDBC](../../../plugins-and-integrations/plugins/configure-repositories/#jdbc).

### Using with `docker compose`

To use JDBC with `docker compose`, edit the `$services.gateway.environment` section and the `$services.management_api.environment` section of the Docker compose file to include the following lines, and remove the lines containing `gravitee_management_mongodb_uri`.

{% code title="docker-compose.yaml" %}
```yaml
       - gravitee_management_type=jdbc
       - gravitee_management_jdbc_url=jdbc:mysql://gravitee-mysql:3306/gravitee?useSSL=false&user=mysql_users&password=mysql_password
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure your `gravitee_management_jdbc_url` is appropriate for your environment. In particular, be cautious about using `useSSL=false` in production.

Your host, port, username, and password may be different.
{% endhint %}

### Using with Docker images

To use JDBC with Docker images, add the following environment variables to the commands used to start the Gateway and the management API.

```sh
  --env gravitee_management_type=jdbc \
  --env gravitee_management_jdbc_url=jdbc:mysql://gravitee-mysql:3306/gravitee?useSSL=false&user=mysql_users&password=mysql_password \
```

You also need to remove the `gravitee_management_mongodb_uri` `env` from the command.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure your `gravitee_management_jdbc_url` is appropriate for your environment. In particular, be cautious about using `useSSL=false` in production.

Your host, port, username, and password may be different.
{% endhint %}
