# Tutorials

## Overview

These tutorials are designed to showcase Gravitee API Management (APIM) functionality with practical use cases. To do this, each tutorial will include a prebuilt sample application that depends on APIM to accomplish its use case.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more detailed exposure to each of APIM's core concepts and features, visit our [Guides section](../../guides/prologue.md).
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

These tutorials demonstrate some [enterprise-only features](../../overview/ee-vs-oss/) and are designed to work seamlessly with Gravitee's enterprise trial.&#x20;

To begin, [sign up for an enterprise trial of Gravitee API Management](../install-guides/free-trial.md). Your first environment will be set up in just a few minutes and is preconfigured with APIs to help demonstrate the value of both traditional and event-native API Management.

Once you're set-up, you can return here to experience the power of Gravitee API Management alongside our sample application.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you haven't already, we highly recommend completing [Gravitee's Quickstart guide](../quickstart-guide/) before completing any of these tutorials.
