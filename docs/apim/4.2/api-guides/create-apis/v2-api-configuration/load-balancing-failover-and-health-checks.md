# Load-Balancing, Failover, and Health Checks

### Backend services: load-balancing, failover, and health checks

Gravitee API Management (APIM) offers three main backend services for managing your APIs. These services are:

* **Load-balancing:** Load-balancing is a technique used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers. The goal of load-balancing is to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single server. The Gravitee Gateway comes with a built-in load balancer, which you can enable and configure for your API endpoints according to your requirements. Check out the interactive UI exploration or the text descriptions to learn more.
* **Failover:** Failover is a mechanism to ensure high availability and reliability of APIs by redirecting incoming traffic to a secondary server or backup system in the event of a primary server failure. Gravitee includes built-in failover mechanisms and capabilities. Check out the interactive UI exploration or the text descriptions to learn more.
* **Health checks:** A health check is a mechanism used to monitor the availability and health of your endpoints and/or your API Gateways. Gravitee includes a built-in health check mechanism that allows you to create global health check configurations. Check out the interactive UI exploration or the text descriptions to learn more.

All of these capabilities are built into the Gravitee APIM platform. The rest of this article will focus on how to configure these services.

### How to configure load-balancing in Gravitee

In order to successfully use Gravitee load-balancing, you'll need to understand two key concepts:

* **Endpoint groups:** A logical grouping of endpoints that share a load-balancing algorithm
* **Load-balancing types:** Gravitee offers four different types of load-balancing:
  * **Round robin:** The algorithm works by maintaining a list of backend servers and assigning each incoming request to the next server on the list. Once the last server on the list has been reached, the algorithm starts again from the beginning of the list, cycling through the servers in a circular fashion.
  * **Random:** The algorithm selects a backend server at random for each incoming request. Each server has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of its current load or processing capacity.
  * **Weighted round robin:** The algorithm works similarly to the Round Robin mode, but doesn't assign incoming requests in a circular fashion. Instead, it assigns requests based on a specified weight that you have given each backend server.
    * For example, if you have endpoint 1 with a weight of 9 and endpoint 2 with a weight of 1, endpoint 1 is selected 9 times out of 10, whereas endpoint 2 is selected only 1 time out of 10.
  * **Weighted random:** Weighted random load-balancing leverages an algorithm that distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers based on a predefined weight assigned to each server. The weight represents the relative capacity or processing power of each server, with higher weights indicating a higher capacity to handle incoming requests. The algorithm works by generating a random number within a defined range, based on the total sum of all server weights. The random number is then used to select one of the backend servers for processing the incoming request.
    * For example, if you have a group of three backend servers, A, B, and C, with weights of 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the total weight of all servers is 6. When an incoming request arrives, the load-balancer generates a random number between 1 and 6. If the number is between 1 and 1 (inclusive), server A is selected. If the number is between 2 and 3, server B is selected. If the number is between 4 and 6, server C is selected.

To configure load-balancing in Gravitee, follow these steps:

1\. Log in to the Gravitee API Management Console.

2\. Load-balancing (as well other backend services) are configured per API. So, head to the **APIs menu.**

![Load-balancing: select the APIs menu.](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/95d2995f-b5b8-482a-bdd8-8109315e9bb7/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=0,38\&br\_px=1493,878\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=39,139)

3\. Find and select the API for which you want to configure load-balancing.

4\. Select the **Edit API** icon.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/2d11dc86-a65a-4c5d-9b1f-cf9646055f77/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=1962,146\&br\_px=3455,986\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=477,139)

5\. Select **Backend services**.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/a87da572-ba67-4258-9d29-3be916be39c1/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=0,628\&br\_px=1493,1468\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=247,139)

6\. From here, you can either configure load-balancing for existing endpoint groups or create a new endpoint group for which to configure load-balancing. For the sake of this article, we will create a new endpoint group from scratch. To do so, select **+ Add new endpoint group**.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/9478f6d1-c0fe-4cb9-acef-577b03d234f8/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=1962,0\&br\_px=3455,840\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=411,132)

7\. You'll be taken to the **General** tab. Here, you will name your endpoint group and select the load-balancing algorithm. For the sake of this article, let's select **Round robin**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please refer to the [load-balancing concepts section](load-balancing-failover-and-health-checks.md#how-to-configure-load-balancing-in-gravitee) if you need in-depth explanations of the various load-balancing algorithms that Gravitee supports.
{% endhint %}

8\. Now, it's time to configure your endpoint group with any additional HTTP details that might be relevant. To do so, select **Configuration**.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/2bb0a7e1-883c-4a37-9cee-ffad16f3ee17/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=751,0\&br\_px=2244,840\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=262,111)

9\. Configure your HTTP details. For example, you might choose to enable **HTTP pipelining,** which will cause requests to be written to connections without waiting for previous responses to return. You can configure many other additional details, such as HTTP protocol version, Connect timeout time (in ms), idle timeout (in ms), SSL options, and more.

</div>

10\. Optional: If you want to enable Service Discovery, select the **Service discovery** tab. Service discovery will enable external endpoints to be dynamically added or removed to or from the group. For more information on Service Discovery, please refer to our documentation on [Gravitee Service discovery](broken-reference).

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/cf7799b5-28eb-4dff-9895-1e7a6f481edb/stack\_animation.webp)

11\. Once you are done defining and configuring your endpoint group, select **Create**.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/46fa5604-2509-48c7-ae72-7c0176a7e4ef/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=1962,556\&br\_px=3455,1396\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=417,139)

12\. Now, it's time to add endpoints to your endpoint group. Once you've done this, you'll be able to configure load-balancing for your endpoint group. Let's head back to the **Endpoints** section of the **Backend Services** menu.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/e338a81b-8c36-4cf1-b927-3f4b7204cea6/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=489,0\&br\_px=1982,840\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=262,78)

13\. You'll see your endpoint group. To add endpoints to this group, **select** + Add endpoint.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/323033e1-0584-474a-87f4-4f9ad075a8e8/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=1823,560\&br\_px=3316,1400\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=262,139)

14\. In the General tab, define your endpoint name, target URL, weight (if you chose a weighted load-balancing algorithm), and your tenants.

![](https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/accdc8c6-ee91-4bd6-a351-9c3a2656360f/stack\_animation.webp)

15\. Optional: Select **Secondary endpoint** to define this endpoint outside the main load-balancing pool. This will make the endpoint used for load-balancing only if all the primary endpoints are marked as down by the health check.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/49f626c6-5ee4-45df-a8f3-5cb76bbcb15d/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=763,1098\&br\_px=2256,1938\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=262,141)

16\. Once you're finished specifying endpoint details in the **General** tab, it's time to configure the HTTP configuration of your endpoint.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/da0973c3-44ba-4cd0-a288-e6ce86b4f185/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=849,166\&br\_px=2342,1006\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=262,139)

17\. By default, the endpoint will inherit configuration from the configuration that you set at the endpoint group level.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Configure load-balancing - Step 17.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

18\. However, if you want to set up HTTP configuration specific to that endpoint, toggle the **Inherit configuration** OFF.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Configure load-balancing - Step 18.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

19\. Once toggled OFF, you can specify a different HTTP configuration for this endpoint. Once you are done, select **Save**.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Configure load-balancing - Step 19.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

20\. For the sake of this example, let's toggle the **Inherit configuration** back ON.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2023-03-07/fd85c6d5-7a13-4dd2-aab8-443fac87cabe/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl\_px=1962,286\&br\_px=3455,1126\&sharp=0.8\&width=560\&wat\_scale=50\&wat=1\&wat\_opacity=0.7\&wat\_gravity=northwest\&wat\_url=https://colony-labs-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/watermark\_default.png\&wat\_pad=443,139)

{% hint style="success" %}
Congrats! Once you're done with your HTTP configuration, you can set up a health check for your endpoint. To learn more about setting up health checks, please refer to the "Health checks" section of this article.
{% endhint %}

### How to configure failover

To configure failover, follow these steps:

1\. First, search for the API whose endpoints you want to configure failover for.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/c49cd12d-c15a-4336-bd9f-c47d12bae8f5/2.5/18.634259259259/19.148284313725?0)

2\. Select the **Edit API** icon.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/45a34f5e-3580-4a1e-8c8a-b0375d25be07/2.5/95.833333333333/49.307436790506?0)

3\. Like load-balancing, failover is a backend service. To make failover configurations, select **Backend services** in the **Proxy** section.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/52c7ec53-d5b7-486c-86ac-e9012ecaa972/1.5/15.046296296296/55.830753353973?0)

4\. Select the **Failover** tab.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/87522d51-7e88-4e61-9f16-6c75c1efd846/2.5/39.467592592593/9.5975232198142?0)

5\. Toggle **Enable Failover** ON.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/213683b2-cd69-4004-83ef-09d68578019c/2.5/36.082175925926/23.735810113519?0)

6\. Next, you'll need to define your **Max Attempts** setting. This setting defines the upper limit for the number of possible Gravitee API Gateway attempts to find a suitable endpoint, according to the load-balancing algorithm, before returning an error.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/b35939dc-685a-411b-afe1-fe1320e9a988/1.2507598784195/64.178240740741/36.532507739938?0)

7\. After you define your **Max Attempts** setting, define your **Timeout** setting. The **Timeout** setting defines the upper limit for time spent (in ms) between each attempt before timing out.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/c1a1ba3a-bb99-476a-bd25-46adb82564a1/1.2507598784195/64.178240740741/56.883707430341?0)

{% hint style="success" %}
Congrats! Once you hit **Save,** you will have configured failover successfully.
{% endhint %}

### Configure Gravitee health checks

To configure health checks in Gravitee, follow these steps:

1\. Select the API for whose endpoints you want to configure a health check.

![](https://dubble-prod-01.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/95835132-46be-42d5-9fa3-9fd374e2b23a.png?0)

2\. Select the **Edit API** icon.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/d5ae9220-2c42-4cd0-9527-b37afe875169/1.5/95.833333333333/49.307436790506?0)

3\. Like load-balancing and failover, health checks are a backend service provided by Gravitee out of the box. Select **Backend services** within the **Proxy** section.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/654ff309-c168-40e0-82e2-a4e38aaed173/1/13.888888888889/56.862745098039?0)

4\. In the **Backend services** menu, select **Health-check**.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/733bdda1-a849-4ed8-a193-018ff3f14568/1.5/53.356481481481/9.5975232198142?0)

5\. Toggle **Enable health-check** ON.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/8f5b6037-f3b0-4e16-8e63-3d8d52b10335/2.5/36.545138888889/37.203302373581?0)

6\. Now, you'll need to define your **Trigger** settings. The first step is to define the **Trigger Schedule**, which will define a time interval between each health check.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/1619e966-8fda-407f-bdc8-36f230e805d5/1.2252234684804/64.178240740741/52.671891124871?0)

7\. Next, enter the HTTP method that will trigger the health check.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/a9a03a97-cd64-4b4d-8e03-11b5fafe0d4c/1.2507598784195/64.178240740741/70.915570175439?0)

8\. Next, define the **Path** that will trigger the health check. Optionally, you can choose to toggle **From root path ('/')** ON. This will apply the path specified at the root URL level. For example, if your endpoint URL is `www.test.com/api`, this option removes `/api` before appending the path.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/f3b66f85-49b5-42fd-bd88-14b51181550c/2.5/35.624757317802/63.466686016512?0)

9\. In the **HTTP Headers** section, you can specify any headers that you want to trigger a health check. You can use the Gravitee Expression Language to configure a header. Available variables are dictionaries and API properties access.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/04225d0c-29bf-4d83-b1c3-7d0e9cbcae6e/2.5/49.956597222222/69.513512641899?0)

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/2b6db031-54e1-42ea-9f65-e668712a835c/2.5/49.956597222222/90.15334752322?0)

11\. In the **Assertions** section, you can specify any conditions to test for in the API response in order to trigger a health check. Assertions are written in Gravitee Expression Language. An assertion can be a simple 200 response (#response.status == 200), but you can also test for specific content.

![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/3e574674-2b01-4f8f-bf29-8f9000a86851/1.3402555910543/62.789351851852/72.078173374613?0)
