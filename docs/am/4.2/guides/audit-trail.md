# Audit Trail

## Overview

AM includes an audit trail feature to record the set of events taking place when users interact with AM.

Login and logout, user management and other administrative operations are stored in a database or remote system (via plugins) and can be reviewed with AM Console or AM API.

## Audit Log

### View the audit log

The AM Console Audit log page displays all events which have taken place, including user authentication and administrative actions such as managing clients, identity providers, users, groups, roles and so on.

1. Log in to AM Console.
2.  Click **Settings > Audit Log**.

All of this information can also be retrieved with the [AM API.](../reference/am-api-reference.md)

### Event types

The following table lists the available log event types. The result of an event can be either SUCCESS or FAILURE.

## Storage

Audit events are managed (store and fetch) by plugins called [Reporters](../getting-started/configuration/configure-reporters.md).

By default, a reporter is created for each security domain and allows you to choose where the audit logs will be stored.

1. Log in to AM Console.
2. Click **Settings > Audit Log**.
3.  Click the settings icon and configure the reporter.

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-logs-audit-reporter.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Configure reporter</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is no log retention. It is up to you define a retention window and periodically clear old data.
{% endhint %}

AM includes by default database reporters based on your AM distribution such as MongoDB or JDBC.

### File reporter

By default, the AM Console Audit log page displays all events which have taken place, including user authentication and administrative actions such as managing clients, identity providers, users, groups, roles, and so on through a MongoDB reporter plugin (or a JDBC plugin, according to your deployment).

AM versions from 3.6 include a file reporter for sending audit logs to a file, which you can use to ingest your logs into a third-party system like ElasticSearch or Splunk.

#### Create a File reporter

To create a File reporter for a domain:

1. Log in to AM Console.
2. Click **Settings > Audit Log**.
3. Click the settings icon ![am settings icon](https://docs.gravitee.io/images/icons/am-settings-icon.png).
4.  Click the plus icon ![plus icon](https://docs.gravitee.io/images/icons/plus-icon.png).

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-add-reporter.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Audit settings</p></figcaption></figure>
5.  Select **File** as the reporter type and enter the reporter name and file name.

#### Example: ingest audit logs into ElasticSearch

The example below demonstrates how to configure audit logs to be ingested using the ELASTICSEARCH format into an Elasticsearch instance using Logstash.

The first step is to define a template for the audit log entries to specify how Elasticsearch will index the data:

```json
{
    "index_patterns": ["gravitee-am-audit-*"],
    "settings": {
        "index.number_of_shards": 1,
        "index.number_of_replicas": 1,
        "index.refresh_interval": "5s"
    },

                    	     "type": "keyword",
                    	     "index": true
                	 },
                	 "referenceId": {
                    	     "type": "keyword",
                    	     "index": true
                	 }
		     }
                }
	}
    }
}
```

Next, you need to create a Logstash configuration:

```
input {
  file {
      codec => "json"
      path => "${gravitee_audit_path}/**/*"
      start_position => beginning
   }
}

filter {
    mutate {
        add_field => { "[@metadata][index]" => "gravitee-am-%{[_type]}-%{[date]}" }
        add_field => { "[@metadata][id]" => "%{[event_id]}" }
        add_field => { "[@metadata][type]" => "%{[_type]}" }
        remove_field => [ "date", "_type", "event_id" ]
    }
}

output {

    elasticsearch {
       hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
       index => "%{[@metadata][index]}"
       document_id => "%{[@metadata][id]}"
       template => "${gravitee_templates_path}/template-audit.json"
       template_name => "gravitee-am-management"
       template_overwrite => true
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The variable `gravitee_audit_path` must match the `reporters.file.directory` value defined in the `gravitee.yml` file.
{% endhint %}

Finally, you can start Logstash:

```
#export gravitee_templates_path=/path/to/template.json
#export gravitee_audit_path=/path/to/audits/
./bin/logstash -f config/gravitee-am-file.conf
```
